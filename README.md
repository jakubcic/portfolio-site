## Description

The site is built with React and TailwindCSS. It is deployed on Githib Pages. The site is fully responsive and works on mobile devices. You can access the site [here](https://jakubcic.github.io/portfolio-site/)!

### Contact

The contact section contains a form that does some input validation. Currently the form does not actually send an email, but it will in the future! I plan to create a small backsend email relay service that will send the email to my actual email address.
