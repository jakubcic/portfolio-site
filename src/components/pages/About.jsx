						I'm new to the web development world and I'm thrilled to jump in with both feet and explore all it
						has to offer! I communicate in English proficiently and in Polish at a B1 level (CEFR). I'm
						currently working as a Web Infrastructure Specialist at a banking software company in Connecticut.
						I've got a degree in Statistics from the University of Connecticut and a burning passion for
						solving problems. I have experience with supporting large distributed applications, application
						deployment, CLI tool development and incident management. I love finding ways to make my team's
						daily work more efficient. I'm constantly on the hunt for new knowledge and I like to think that
						if there were a certification for internet searching your way out of a problem, I'd have one by
						now. I'm also a huge fan of online privacy and open source software. Let's make the internet a
						better place together!
